INTRODUCTION
------------
This project is designed basically for learning purposes. It was created to facilitate the possiblities of developing astonishing websites using minimum efforts. It was during the cause of my learning experience at codeacademy.com that I came to appreciate elegant teaching style with great simplicity to details that can even help my DAD at his age learn to code the web.  A tool set that happens to be the in-thing this days on this Jet-Age.

ERRATA
-------
During the cause of development, I was in a hurry trying to beat my time of pushing up a repository on GitHub using the skills I've obtained and thus there might be errors at certain places. Please feel free to "fork" or send me a mail me@ccemenike.com and I'll be glad to respond
